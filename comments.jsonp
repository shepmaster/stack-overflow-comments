{ "name": "[Q] MCVE", "description": "It's hard to answer your question because it doesn't include a [MRE]. We can't tell what crates (and their versions), types, traits, fields, etc. are present in the code. It would make it easier for us to help you if you try to reproduce your error on the <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org\">Rust Playground</a> if possible, otherwise in a brand new Cargo project, then [edit] your question to include the additional info. There are <a href=\"//$SITEURL$/tags/rust/info\">Rust-specific MRE tips</a> you can use to reduce your original code for posting here. Thanks!"},

{ "name": "[Q] Duplicate", "description": "It looks like your question might be answered by the answers of [](). If not, please <strong>[edit]</strong> your question to explain the differences. Otherwise, we can mark this question as already answered."},

{ "name": "[Q] Entire error", "description": "Please [edit] your question and paste the exact and entire error that you're getting â€” that will help us to understand what the problem is so we can help best. Sometimes trying to interpret an error message is tricky and it's actually a different part of the error message that's important. Please use the message from running the compiler directly, not the message produced by an IDE, which might be trying to interpret the error for you."},

Please separate them into multiple questions so that we can help you better and so that your questions will help others in the future that have one of the same questions as you!"},

{ "name": "[Q] Answer in question", "description": "It's great that you have the solution to your question! You should post it as an answer rather than an edit to your question and then potentially accept that answer. That way, the question shows up as solved in search results, people can vote on your answer, and your solution can be more helpful to future people with the same problem."},

{ "name": " Idiomatic style", "description": "By the way, idiomatic Rust uses `snake_case` for variables, methods, macros, fields and modules; `UpperCamelCase` for types and enum variants; and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for statics and constants."},
